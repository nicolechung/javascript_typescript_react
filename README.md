## Explanation of Redux in this project
This example is just to demo ways to type `connect` when using react-redux. To that end, **do not use this sample project** as an example of a case when you need to use redux.

This is such a simple project, you would never need to really use Redux, I'm just using it here to demo how to use Typescript with `connect`. Do not use Redux on an app this small! Just stick to local (React) state.
